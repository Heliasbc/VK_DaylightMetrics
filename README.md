# VK_DaylightMetrics_script

This repository is meant for Grasshopper scripts used by Tegnestuen Vandkunsten to simulate daylighting for buildings. To use the script properly you are expected to have a basic understanding of Rhino and/or Grasshopper. 

To use you need to have a working version of Rhino 6 or Rhino 7. Also, the scrips uses the plug-in Ladybug Tools 1.1.0 for Grasshopper. To use Ladybug tools correctly the program Radiance needs to be downloaded and installed, see how to Ladybug Tools and Radiance in https://github.com/ladybug-tools/lbt-grasshopper/wiki. 

Several other plug-ins are also used in the script. They can be installed by either downloading this repository and installing the plug-ins through Grasshopper or you can find the plug-ins on https://www.food4rhino.com/.

Some standard weatherfiles from European cities have been added to the repository, find other weatherfiles at https://www.ladybug.tools/epwmap/.

Besides the DaylightMetrics_script are a tutorial on how to use the script and a Rhino.3dm file, which is the model used in the toturial, that can be used to follow along.
