# VK_DaylightMetrics_script

This repository is meant for Grasshopper scripts used by Tegnestuen Vandkunsten to simulate daylighting for buildings. To use the script properly you are expected to have a basic understanding of Rhino and/or Grasshopper.

Furthermore, you need a working (and validated) version of Rhino 6 or Rhino 7. Also, the scripts uses the plug-in Ladybug Tools 1.1.0 ('VER 0.0.06\nJUL_07_2020') for Grasshopper and Honeybee[+] 0.0.06. To use Ladybug tools correctly the program Radiance needs to be downloaded and installed, see how to INSTALL Ladybug Tools and Radiance in https://github.com/ladybug-tools/lbt-grasshopper/wiki. For Honeybee [+] download from https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/ladybug-tools.
