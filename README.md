# VK_DaylightMetrics_script

This repository is meant for Grasshopper scripts used by Tegnestuen Vandkunsten to simulate daylighting for buildings. To use the script properly you are expected to have a basic understanding of Rhino and/or Grasshopper. 

Furthermore, yoy need a working (and validated) version of Rhino 6 or Rhino 7. Also, the scrips uses the plug-in Ladybug Tools 1.1.0 for Grasshopper. To use Ladybug tools correctly the program Radiance needs to be downloaded and installed, see how to Ladybug Tools and Radiance in https://github.com/ladybug-tools/lbt-grasshopper/wiki.
